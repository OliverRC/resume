## Work Experience

### Senior Developer - Derivco
`February 2009 – Present (12 years 7 months)`

Currently I am part of an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning team. Our mandate has been to promote machine learning throughout the organization. We are a small team that started with 4 team members but keep growing. 

The team's goal is to promote machine learning within the company by solving a number of key technical challenges and demonstrate how machine learning can be implemented by tackling a few interesting and useful use cases.

We are busy finalizing our production platform that will: handle moving of data, manage ETL processes, address data governance and compliance requirements, but most importantly allow the democratization of relevant business data to be used in the development of machine learning algorithms and models.

Other notable achievements in my time at Derivco:

#### HTTP/JSON API Re-architecture:
I was the technical lead, with a colleague, on a project to re-design, implement and update the architecture of our core gaming system and supporting components.
The redesign goal was to move our systems from an old monolithic, stateful, custom TCP based architecture to a HTTP/JSON, restful, API based, microservice architecture.
We succussfully deployed the new architecture and decommissioned the legacy systems through a series of systematic deployments over the course of a year.
Doing so dramatically reduced the physical footprint and improved reliability, scalability as well as consolidated our integration endpoints into a single collection of easy to consume HTTP/JSON API's.
Over the course of the project we set new company standards for API development, implemented a number of core libraries and championed the use of Application Insights for application monitoring.

#### Tool and Library Development:
Over the course of the years I have been a core contributor to a large number of the core libraries and tools used widely throughout the organization. 
For example:
 - Boilerplate libraries for security, configuration, documentation and monitoring of our .NET Framework and .NET Core API’s.
 - Swagger / OpenAPI code generator for generating both C# client, model libraries as well as generating HTML documentation for the API’s. 
 - Swagger / OpenAPI web front end for viewing organizations API documentation.

#### Core Security and Configuration System:
In a project when the company was introducing our first set of API's the organization required a way to secure calls between Services and API's and a configuration system to manage service and database discovery.
I worked as a senior developer with the solutions architects to design and implement the core security and configuration systems which are still used extensively to this day.
These systems were critical to their dependent API's and Services and so had to be "bulletproof" and offer what we eventually termed "ultra-highavailability".
Since the organization has hosting locations all around the globe, the system also had to handle replication of configuration across all our data centers.

#### Statistics Monitoring:
One of my first large projects as a junior developer working with the solution architects to build a system to monitor the internal financial performance statistics of our games. I was responsible for developing a web front end for our Maths and Game Design teams to monitor in order to catch any anomalous behaviour. The system is still currently being used today.

## Interests

I am a bit of a car nut. I have always loved cars with an affinity to "JDM Legends" although I like all things performance cars. Currently the proud owner of a modified 2012 Evo X.

Naturally computers have always been a big interest of mine and I enjoy PC + Console gaming, movies and series. 
Obviously all things tech make up a huge part of my interests. From audiophile sound systems to networking, tv to server builds, lighting setups, smart home gear if its tech I am probably interested.
Like they say... "all my vices are devices".

Outside of tech and cars family life is extremely important to me and I adore my partner and young daughter.
